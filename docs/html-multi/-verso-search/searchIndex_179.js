Formal Proof in Lean","context":"Lean Mathematical Puzzles\u0009Quartic Equation","contents":"The proof is split into two parts. In the first part, it is shown that\n-6, -6 -\\sqrt{10} and -6 +\\sqrt{10} are solutions.\n\nIn the second part, it is shown that these are the only solutions.\n\nThis also follows from the fact that a quartic equation\nhas at most four solutions and that the multiplicity of -6\nas solution is two.\n\nHowever, we rather go the hard way using only basic facts\nabout real numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}});
